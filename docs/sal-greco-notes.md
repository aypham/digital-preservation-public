Folder: `/McLUHAN MEIDA INSTALLATION 2011  FOLDER_complete`

Overview:

- generally appears to contain materials created in 2011 with varying degrees of relation to Marshall McLuhan
- contains materials created / consolidated / curated for this event (including materials he appears to have just downloaded from the internet) https://mcluhangalaxy.wordpress.com/2011/07/19/mcluhan-legacy-network-mcluhan%E2%80%99s-media-an-installation-toronto/
- `Sal_Audio Files` contains raw audio created for the installation (voice actor is someone named Paula, could not catch last name)

Problematic materials:

- particularly problematic are audio files for the song "Ballad of Marshall McLuhan" (https://vimeo.com/8022406) (https://soundcloud.com/sean11/marshall-mcluhan) by Montreal band The Vestibules and "BLINK" (https://vimeo.com/28641724) by Canadian filmmaker Miles Jay, it's possible Greco got permission from the artists for the installation but unlikely that he got permission to retain their work
- also contains student work
  - `/Wil Noack  For Sal`
  - `ZUMASCOPE_mediacontent.mp4`
  - `/Zumascope_v1.0_(1280x720).app`
    - Zumascope short is a thesis project for the Master's of Media Program (see `Zumascope Blurb.rtf` for more details) IMDB page for short and creator credits found here: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1966651/?ref_=nm_flmg_t_6_prd
